# unsigned-char-array-ifyer
***
A simple helper tool for transforming any binary file to a C-style unsigned char array that can be
printed to STDOUT or (with the -o flag) to a file that can be included in any C project.
Use it in your compiler toolchain to statically include binary data at build time.
